One afternoon, he stirred up a fragrant, caramel-colored liquid and, when it was done, he carried it a few doors down to Jacobs\\'92 Pharmacy. Here the mixture was combined with carbonated water and sampled by customers who all agreed this new drink was something special. So Jacobs\\'92 Pharmacy put it on sale for 5 cents a glass.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy the way in 1943 the U.S. government requested that Coca-Cola be made available to the troops.

While this phenomenon has been known for centuries, and was described by Aristotle, Bacon, and Descartes, it was not introduced to the modern scientific community until 1969, by a Tanzanian high school pupil named Mpemba.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is still not known exactly why this happens. A number of possible explanations for the effect have been proposed, but so far the experiments do not show clearly which, if any, of the proposed mechanisms is the most important one. But at the moment we have 2 most popular explanations.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFirst, all water evaporates, which means that the liquid (water) \\\\\"disappears\\\\\" and becomes a vapor, or gas. Hot water evaporates at a much faster rate than cold water. This means that the bowl with hot water actually had less water than the bowl with cold water, which helped it freeze more quickly. Second, convection (the transfer of heat within the water as it moves around) plays a part in helping hot water freeze more quickly than the bowl of cold water. The hot water has more convection currents than cold water, causing it to cool down much more quickly. That's why your bath water always seems to get cold much faster than you'd like!\",\\\n",

Glistening white plateaus, dark crevices, and slimy surfaces boast steamy temperatures of 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The microbes bathe in a saliva-induced humidity of 100 percent, and eat a lavish diet of sugar and other carbohydrates. Scientists from the faculty of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine have found 615 different species of bacteria living in oral cavity \\'96 and they\\'92re still counting.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nResearchers (very patient researchers) have painstakingly harvested all the plaque from every surface of every tooth. It weighs, on average, about 10 mg. But the teeth only comprise 1/20 of all the oral surfaces. You have to multiply the 10 mg from the teeth by 20 to get the total biomass including cheeks, tongue, etc. We also know that 1 mg of oral biomass typically contains about 100 million microbes. By multiplying the number of microbes in 1 mg by 20, we get the total number of microbes in the entire oral cavity: 100 million microbes x 20 mg biomass = 20 billion oral microbes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat is even more interesting is that years of detecting and identifying mouth tenants have revealed that bacteria living in healthy mouths can be remarkably different from those living in diseased mouths.\",\\\n",

The birds can see for long distances, thanks to their height and sharp eyes, allowing them to spot predators before they get too close.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, birds tend to have smaller brains than mammals of a similar size.

The mosquito would then need to find prey from which to suck blood, then it would need several days for the eggs to mature, to meet a mate and lay the eggs in a pond or marsh.

The sand you\\'92d find at the beach or near water (maritime sand) is coarser as a result of water erosion. This is the type of sand Saudi Arabia needs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut Saudi Arabia has almost 1,700 miles of coastline. How do they need more maritime sand? Due to years of growth in the country, particularly in the areas of construction, Saudi Arabia has a large shortage of useable maritime sand. As a result, they\\'92ve turned to countries like Australia and Scotland to get their sand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSaudi Arabia is not the only country in need of sand. China uses more sand in one year than the United States used in the entire 20th century. China is so hungry for sand, that they\\'92re dredging almost a million tons of it per day out Lake Poyang. The world is consuming millions of tons of sand a day, but the process of making it takes thousands of years. As the population grows, more infrastructure is needed to support it.

Studies show having a smile on your face can release endorphins, which make you feel better and help boost your mood and improve sleep. If you are able to put a smile on your face, the laughter will come more easily and the stress will melt more readily.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen you are stressed, your body releases cortisol. Because it\\'92s known as the stress hormone, cortisol gets a bad rap, but it plays an important role in the body. It helps manage blood sugar levels, reduces inflammation, manages metabolism, and triggers the fight or flight response in your body at critical times. But too much cortisol and your body feels that stress. Laughter is one of the ways your body can help regulate cortisol. Laughing increases your oxygen intake, which stimulates body circulation and decreases your cortisol levels. Some studies show that just the act of laughing\\'97without having humor in it\\'97can have positive stress-relieving effects.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSome of the other benefits of laughter also include boosting your immune system, a defense against infectious organisms entering through the respiratory tract, a lowering of your blood pressure and increasing of your vascular blood flow.\",\\\n",

The exact time it take for food to pass through the digestive tract depends on the amount and types of food. Factors such as sex, metabolism, and a range of digestive issues can also affect the speed of the digestive process.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn general, food takes 24 to 72 hours to move through your digestive tract. At first, food travels relatively quickly through your digestive system. Within 6 to 8 hours, the food has moved its way through your stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Once in your large intestine, the partially digested contents of your meal can sit for more than a day while it\\'92s broken down even more. The normal range for transit time includes the following: gastric emptying (2 to 5 hours), small bowel transit (2 to 6 hours), colonic transit (10 to 59 hours), and whole gut transit (10 to 73 hours).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYour digestion rate is also based on what you\\'92ve eaten. Meat and fish can take as long as 2 days to fully digest. The proteins and fats they contain are complex molecules that take longer for your body to pull apart. By contrast, fruits and vegetables, which are high in fiber, can move through your system in less than a day. In fact, these high fiber foods help your digestive track run more efficiently in general.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe quickest to digest are processed, sugary junk foods like candy bars.

The old city of Damascus is considered to be among the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. Excavations at Tell Ramad on the outskirts of the city have demonstrated that Damascus was inhabited as early as 8,000 to 10,000 BC. However, it is not documented as an important city until the arrival of the Aramaeans. In the Medieval period, it was the centre of a flourishing craft industry, with different areas of the city specializing in particular trades or crafts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe city exhibits outstanding evidence of the civilizations which created it - Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Islamic. In particular, the Umayyad caliphate created Damascus as its capital, setting the scene for the city's ongoing development as a living Muslim, Arab city, upon which each succeeding dynasty has left and continues to leave its mark.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn spite of Islam's prevailing influence, traces of earlier cultures particularly the Roman and Byzantine continue to be seen in the city.

When Alexander the great passed away in 323 BCE in Babylon, his entire empire was divided between his generals. Ptolemy I Soter, a pure Macedonian Greek, companion and historian of Alexander, received Egypt. Ptolemy I Soter was the founder of the Ptolemy Dynasty.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCleopatra was born in 69 BCE, to Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra V (members of the Ptolemy dynasty preferred incest to preserve the purity of their bloodline) in Alexandria, Egypt. She was the 2nd daughter of Ptolemy XII. She was the 7th descendant of the Ptolemy dynasty, inheriting the name Cleopatra VII, simply known as Cleopatra. So, it\\'92s clear that Cleopatra was not an Egyptian but a Macedonian Greek.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShe was the last descendant of the Macedonians to rule Egypt. She ruled Egypt for 21 years. Although she wasn\\'92t an Egyptian, she was the only one in her family who learned the Egyptian language. Apart from Egyptian, she also knew many other languages and she was also a naval commander. Cleopatra was known for her administrative skills and intellectual personality which made her even more desirable. She was highly accomplished as a human being and garnered the respect of all her subjects. She was even worshipped by Egyptians for over 400 years.\",\\\n",

It was between Britain and Zanzibar, known as the Anglo-Zanzibar War, and resulted in a British victory.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe immediate cause of the war was the death of the pro-British Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of Sultan Khalid bin Barghash. The British authorities preferred Hamoud bin Mohammed, who was more favorable to British interests, as sultan. In the agreement of 14 June 1890 instituting a British protectorate over Zanzibar, a candidate for accession to the sultanate should obtain the permission of the British consul, and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a casus belli and sent an ultimatum to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe ultimatum expired at 09:00 East Africa Time (EAT) on 27 August. A bombardment, opened at 09:02, set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. \\uc0\\u1040 fter a short fight the flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:46.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received asylum in the German consulate before escaping to German East Africa (in the mainland part of present Tanzania). The British quickly placed Sultan Hamoud in power at the head of a puppet government. The war marked the end of the Zanzibar Sultanate as a sovereign state and the start of a period of heavy British influence.\",\\\n",

At first, the categories were general but they were later divided into specific categories such as literature in a drama, lyric or epic; orchestral and instrumental music, solo and chorus singing; drawings, graphic arts and paintings; statues, reliefs, medals, plaques and medallions. Even architecture made an appearance on the programme, with its own town planning category.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe art competitions were dropped from the Olympic program because of the difficulty of determining the amateur status of the artists.\",\\\n",

Actually, sodium chloride added to water will decrease the volume of the solution, up to around 2% for a saturated solution.\",\\\n",

The quick version of why the number four is unlucky is that it sounds just like the word for death.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBecause the number four is considered unlucky on such a broad scale, you'll see many examples of this fear in daily life across almost all East-Asian cultures. You never want to give four of something (try three or five instead). Elevators will often be missing a fourth floor. In extreme cases, floors 40-49 (and sometimes any floor with a four in it) will also be  missing. This is similar to how some buildings will skip the 13th floor in Western cultures. In China, military aircrafts start with the number 5, as in the \\\\\"Shenyang J-5. Taiwanese and South Korean Navies don't use the number 4 for their pendant numbers.

With 75 people the chances rise to 99 per cent!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe birthday paradox is strange, counter-intuitive, and completely true. It\\'92s only a \\'93paradox\\'94 because our brains can\\'92t handle the compounding power of exponents. We expect probabilities to be linear and only consider the scenarios we\\'92re involved in (both faulty assumptions, by the way).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe could list the pairs and count all the ways they could match. But that\\'92s hard: there could be 1, 2, 3 or even 23 matches!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt\\'92s like asking \\'93What\\'92s the chance of getting one or more heads in 23 coin flips?\\'94 There are so many possibilities: heads on the first throw, or the 3rd, or the last, or the 1st and 3rd, the 2nd and 21st, and so on.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHow do we solve the coin problem? Flip it around. Rather than counting every way to get heads, find the chance of getting all tails, our \\'93problem scenario\\'94.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf there\\'92s a 1% chance of getting all tails, there\\'92s a 99% chance of having at least one head. If we subtract the chance of a problem scenario from 1 we are left with the probability of a good scenario.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe same principle applies for birthdays. Instead of finding all the ways we match, find the chance that everyone is different, the \\'93problem scenario\\'94. We then take the opposite probability and get the chance of a match.\",\\\n",
